# VisualizerApplication

VisualizerApplication is a Java-based tool designed to help you visualize all major Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. With this intuitive application, learners and enthusiasts can see the inner workings of algorithms and data structures, making it easier to understand and master DSA fundamentals.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step execution and visualization of popular data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.).
- **Algorithm Demonstrations**: See in real-time how sorting, searching, traversal, and other algorithms operate.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and clean UI for easy navigation and use.
- **Educational Tooltips**: Get helpful explanations and tips as you interact with the visualizations.
- **Custom Input**: Try your own data and watch how the algorithms respond.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- (Optional) An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TechajayBT/VisualizerApplication.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd VisualizerApplication
   ```
3. **Build and run the application:**
   - If using an IDE, open the project and run the main class.
   - If using the command line:
     ```bash
     javac -d bin src/**/*.java
     java -cp bin Main
     ```

## Usage

- Launch the application.
- Select a data structure or algorithm to visualize.
- Enter custom data or use sample data.
- Step through the execution and observe how the algorithm operates.
